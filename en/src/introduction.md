This documentation is being built with new tools on a new platform...

Initially by copying the original text from framp's website.

Currently the structure isn't finalized and most pages are empty or "broken",
especially regarding links and formatting.
The German version is more complete yet.

That means: For now it's **work in progress**.

There are two language versions, *german* and *english*.
Dynamically selectable with the language selector on the top right.

# Introduction

> raspiBackup - Create backup versions of your Raspberry Pis regularly/automatically.

A regular backup of your Raspberry Pis is important. In case of a failure of the system device
(SD Card, USB disk, USB flash drive, SSD, NVMe ...) or unintended updates which cause the system either
not to boot any more or boot with errors this backup enables you to restore a previous functional backup. 

*raspiBackup* creates a backup of Raspberry Pis **from a running system**.
You can either start the backup manually or have the backups be started automatically with systemd or crontab.
Optionally you can let you notified about the backup result with eMail, Pushover, Slack or Telegram.

Backups can be created ony an devices which can be mounted on a Linux system 
(USB flash drive, USB disk, SSD, NVMe, nfs, samba, sshfs, etc.).

If you own an Synology or another NAS device see [here](more-backupspaces.md) for configuration hints.

Linux backuptools `dd` backup, `tar` backup, (both backups can also be zipped) and a `rsync` backup
with hardlink usage to create a delta backup can be used.
For details about the different backup methods see [here](backuptypes.md).
There you will find a decision tree to decide which backup methods is the right one to use.

There exists an installer for raspiBackup to install and configure raspiBackup 
similar to raspi-config, menuedriven to configure raspiBackup with it's most important options to be able to use raspiBackup.
All more sophisticated options have to be configured in a configuration file.

raspiBackup also restores a backup [Restore](restore.md). 

All functions and usage scenarios of *raspiBackup* are listed in
[Functionoverview](function-overview.md)..

## Supported hard- and software

See [Supported hard- and software](supported-hardware-and-software.md)

## Stop and start of services

To get a consistent backup of a running system all services which keep important information in memory
have to be stopped before a backup starts and should be started when the backup finishes, 

The required commands can be specified in the configuration file. The raspiBackup installer allows to
select systemd services to be stopped and started and no configuration file update is required.

There exist [extensionpoints](hooks-for-own-scripts.md) for plugins in *raspiBackup*, to hock in any
additonal custom logic at different points of the backup and restore processing.

## Optionally external root partition

If an old Raspberry should be seaved which doesn't support USB boot an external root partition referred by
the SD boot partition will be saved also.

There exists the normal backup mode which just saves
/boot and /root. Partition oriented mode saves any number of partitions starting with release 0.6.6.

## Credits

raspiBackup wouldn't have the features and quality without folks from the community who asked for features and helped to test new features
and created PRs to add new featutures. Ths list will be very long and I was very busy to update the list in the past. I finally stopped to publish and update the list.

Thank you very much to everybody who helped to improve raspiBackup !
